# vanilla-vs-react

In this repository you will find two directories. The first one is a starter template for creating a basic counter website using vanilla HTML and JS (TS). The other is similarly a starter template for creating the same basic counter website using React. The starter templates include the necessary files for getting started, such as the `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `.gitignore`, `index.html`, and a `src` directory containing the necessary TypeScript files. These files are there so that you can focus on creating the website, instead of dealing with the setup of the project.

## How to use the starter projects

It is encouraged that you clone or download the GitHub repo, and then just copy and paste the starter templates into separate directories on your own computer. You can also turn those repos into Git repos to enable Git functionality. You can then use the `npm install` command to download and install the necessary dependencies.
